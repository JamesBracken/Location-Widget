### Strategy

The aim of the project is to create a responsive accessible widget which uses user location services and the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to provide information about local weather. 

The project provides a hourly and 3 day(Limited because of Weather API free plan) forecast widgets which update in real time using React. Additionally the project sports dynamic background images according to the current weather and adjusts the overlay and text colors according to the time of day.

**Agile Methodology**

This project followed an agile methodology approach to be able to reach an MVP prior to adding in extra features. We developed the project iteratively adding features one at a time.

User Stories were used to organize, plan out and think from the perspective of our potential users. With this approach we were able to plot out a roadmap which we could use to develop our entire application.
